# Timing Processing rules

* match current day
* FUTURE timing range (watch timezone)
* Match sport_type e.g. Run
* match only original entries i.e. create vs change
* Take best possible time (in case multiple activities)
* find fastest consequentive race distance
* Take largest distance (e.g. !0k among 10 and 5)
* FUTURE (check splits)
* FUTURE check GPS location
* FUTURE farthest distance among all races
* FUTURE Check race registration
* Check activity time after start of the race....and FUTURE close before close
* FUTURE check paused activities ??? How to?
* Check Gender
* FUTURE Duplicate activities (duplicate apps)
